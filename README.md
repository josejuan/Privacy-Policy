# Privacy Policy

The following privacy policy statement applies to:

* Face 2 Face Battleships

Under no circumstances does the application record, store or transmit any information that could identify the network, the device or the user of the application (for example but not limited to: personal identification numbers, emails, social network accounts or aliases, etc.)

The text fields that may be required, are only for the dynamics of the application itself and must be used only and exclusively for the purposes indicated. It is the user's responsibility not to enter private information such as e-mails, telephone numbers, etc. in them.

The application may maintain local information on the device or on a remote server, but only information generated by the application itself and related only to the dynamics of the application. In no case will this information serve or be used for any purpose other than the purpose of the application itself.

The application will never extract, send or store information that has not been generated by itself (for example a random puzzle) or that has been introduced by the user for the dynamics of the application (for example an alias or generic name to differentiate several players).
